Make sure you do a "git checkout cap02" in this repo.

Just do "vagrant up" and you will have a master node for the git instance mentioned in the chapter and a node1 for the first instance you can experiment.

The machines can communicate by using "git.example.com", "node1.example.com", etc.

Have fun ;)
