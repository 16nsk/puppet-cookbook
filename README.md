# Puppet Cookbook

**This is based on the book [Puppet Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/puppet-cookbook-third-edition)**

_The implementation may look very different from the book as at the same time I was learning to use Vagrant both for local development and for cloud deployment purposes_

Most of the manifests and modules are respecting the code that would be tested based on the book, but it has been adapted to work in a Vagrant environment.

To follow this repo, you should check the history of commits.
